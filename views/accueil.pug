 "Are you floundering with what to put on your homepage? Second-guessing yourself until you’re paralyzed?

 I see it all the time—from all types of companies. Even experienced digital marketers struggle to nail their homepage content.

This post is in part a checklist, how-to, and planning tool. I can’t tell you precisely what to put on your homepage, but I know if you understand your options you’ll be better prepared to piece together a smart homepage with content conceived to achieve your goals."
